AI NOTES:
If last guess had a hit, guess an adjacent square if not hit already. Updated error so it can't guess off board guesses.
If last two guesses were in line, pick another in-line shot next to the previous shot.
If last guess missed but previous two hit then pick in-line on opposite side
If last guess missed but guess before that hit, pick adjacent to that previous hit again
If previous two hits missed but shot before that hit, try another direction from the hit shot coord
